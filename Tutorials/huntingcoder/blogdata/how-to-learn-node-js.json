Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting\u2014running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.\r\n\r\nNode.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I\/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input\/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).",
